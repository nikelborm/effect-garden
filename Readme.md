# My effect garden

A place where I carefully grow species of my favorite flower bindweed. In
programmer terms -- all my pet-projects, most of which will be somehow be
related to effect.

## TODO

1. documentation on scripts
2. integrate hot reload from [nounder/effect-start](https://github.com/nounder/effect-start)?
3. write auto tool that will scan packages folder, and properly fill
   dependencies of root package json, exposing all the stuff, and then will
   properly set dependencies of playground, and then call `bun install`
