# Integrate [nounder/effect-memfs](https://github.com/nounder/effect-memfs/) into tests

# Try to use .handler method on crafted commands in tests

([example](https://github.com/schickling/dilagent/blob/77d7d90d19d921841a18df350b6430c5bdc9eea3/apps/dilagent-cli/src/commands/manager/all.ts#L63))

# Make better tests

- [ ] Write tests to reach 90%+ coverage
- [ ] integrate arbitrariness like
- [ ] integrate mutation tests like [stryker-js](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-js) or [mutasaurus](https://github.com/christoshrousis/mutasaurus) or find something `effect` specific
- [ ] integrate property based tests like [fast-check](https://fast-check.dev/docs/tutorials/quick-start/our-first-property-based-test/)

This issue is also applicable to all my other repos

https://github.com/tatethurston/embedded-typescript for tstyche

Hi! I started integrating it very actively and wrote a few test files with it,
but just haven't committed it. The codebase of the project that uses it is kinda
a mess, because I started making a BIG rewrite of the tests.

I didn't try embedded-typescript. I just noted it as something similar.

But i found a lot of other libs that play REALLY well with this feature

The links are kinda not in a place you would expect them to be.

In issue https://github.com/nikelborm/fetch-github-folder/issues/41 you will
find links to `code-block-writer`, `ts-poet`, `ts-morph`,
`ts-code-factory-generator-generator` libs that play well with this
type-test-template feature

The codebase I will be integrating this tstyche feature first, will be this
https://github.com/nikelborm/joiners/issues/2

So you better track that issue

As a note to just me: maybe try to use this for fs mocking

# Write docs for exported into JSR package functions and constants

TODO:

- [ ] Integrate auto audit of JSDoc using GitHub Actions:
      https://deno.com/blog/document-javascript-package#audit-your-jsdoc
- [ ] Write JSDoc themselves
- [x] Rename all symbols related to error classes so they actually behave like
      classes. Extracted type of const should be of instance type not constructor
      type

Useful:

1. [How to document JS package in Deno](https://deno.com/blog/document-javascript-package)
2. [How to write docs for JSR](https://jsr.io/docs/writing-docs#symbol-documentation)
3. [All JSDoc tokens](https://jsdoc.app/)
4. [Supported JSDoc tags by Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/doc/#supported-jsdoc-tags)

Fix the fact that in JSR it renders as shit (example: [GitHubApiThingNotExistsOrYouDontHaveAccessError](https://jsr.io/@nikelborm/fetch-github-folder/doc/~/GitHubApiThingNotExistsOrYouDontHaveAccessError))

Maybe cover this during fixing https://github.com/nikelborm/fetch-github-folder/issues/41

read and follow [diataxis guidelines](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/)

# Refactor Readme

1. Write more ways to install project ()deno, bun
2. Show CLI's --help
3. Record wizard gif
4. find and analyze competitors (e.g.
   [libraries.io search result with similar libs](https://libraries.io/search?q=fetch+github+folder&sort=latest_release_published_at))
   and their features

Competitor: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch

Maybe use [asciicinema](https://asciinema.org/) to demo usage of the CLI?

# Better error reporting

Don't just crash and throw JSON of error. Filter some of them, retry, etc. Maybe use [jpb06/effect-errors](https://github.com/jpb06/effect-errors)

1. Rewrite FS operations to use Stream and FileSystem modules
2. do retries in cases of FS operation failures

TODO: make PR to [jpb06/effect-errors](https://github.com/jpb06/effect-errors) to support errors from CLI module?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc671c4e-5a40-4787-b075-25cad2390ecc)

Also add dts maps, so that it's easy to jump into ts source

# Add retries and rateLimit delays

Probably borrow [jpb06/effect-github-stats/.../handle-octokit-request-error.ts](https://github.com/jpb06/effect-github-stats/blob/main/src/layer/errors/handle-octokit-request-error.ts)

# Ability to parse targets from links

There are a lot of URLs that have all the data we need, and we can easily extract target info from them such as blobSha, treeSha, branchName, repoName, ownerName, etc...

# Add support for auth

- [ ] Ability to take token from env and prompt (CLI flag to enable prompt)
- [ ] Optimistically try to download repo, if fails with 404, make a few
      requests to determine if it's really an auth issue. Reflect responses and
      determine if that's a public repo and we don't need an API key. If it is
      private, don't block entire process from loading other shit in parallel, but
      send request to a queue of targets blocked by auth and keep downloading stuff,
      until interrupted by user to enter token.
- [ ] Hide auth token behind Effect.Redacted (do not provide CLI option for
      token directly because of bash history. (mention this in --help) )
- [ ] Ability to have independent failed auth queues so that we can ask for a
      different token if one was bad
- [ ] Possibility for quick request of token through browser (script opens a
      window and runs the request as authorized user)

# Support creating downloading plans

User should be able to specify more than one entity (folder/file) to download

# Add more publishing options

# Parallelize fetching directories

After we fetched metadata of a directory we already know it's contents and if it has nested directories, we can load them as subtrees in parallel, if there are a finite amount of them (parallelizing loading of 20+ elements won't end good)

We initially make metadata request and before downloading actual file/folder, we can already ensure, it's something we need, or don't
