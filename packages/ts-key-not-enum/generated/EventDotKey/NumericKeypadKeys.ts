 *   These keys are found on the keyboard's numeric keypad. However, not all are
 *   present on every keyboard. Although typical numeric keypads have numeric
 *   keys from `0` to `9` (encoded as `"0"` through `"9"`), some multimedia
 *   keyboards include additional number keys for higher numbers.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 *
 * > The `10` key, if present, generates events with the `key` value of `"0"`.
