 *   Because modern remote controls for media devices often include buttons beyond
 *   the basic controls covered elsewhere in this document, key values are
 *   defined for a broad array of these additional buttons.
 *
 *   The values below are derived in part from a number of consumer electronics
 *   technical specifications:
 *
 *   - [DTV Application Software
 *       Environment](https://www.atsc.org/atsc-documents/a100-dtv-application-software-environment-level-1-dase-1/)
 *       (part of the [ATSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC) specification)
 *   - [Open Cable Application
 *       Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCable_Application_Platform)
 *   - [ANSI/CEA-2014-B](https://shop.cta.tech/products/cta-2014): Web-based
 *       Protocol and Framework for Remote User Interface on UPnP™ Networks and
 *       the Internet.
 *   - [Android KeyEvent key code
 *       values](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html)
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 *
 * > Remote controls typically include keys whose values are already defined
 *   > elsewhere, such as under [Multimedia
 *   > keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values#multimedia_keys)
 *   > or [Audio control
 *   > keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values#audio_control_keys).
 *   > Those keys' values will match what's documented in those tables.
