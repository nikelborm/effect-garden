 *   While various platforms support different numbers of the general-purpose
 *   function keys, such as `F1` – `F12` (or `F1` – `F10`, or `F1` – `F15`,
 *   etc.), the first few are specifically defined as follows.
 *
 *   If more function keys are available, their names continue the pattern here by
 *   continuing to increment the numeric portion of each key's name, so that,
 *   for example, `"F24"` is a valid key value.
